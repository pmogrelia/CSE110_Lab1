I am passionate about software engineering and have hands-on experience through internships and projects. My favourite experience has been working at the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department at UCSD, where I manage and set-up all online course systems using MATLAB and Google Apps Scripts until 2030. I also oversee the maintenance of the [central course site](https://mae156b.ucsd.edu/), fixing issues dating back to 2014.

Apart from job work, I am an avid gamer and game developer. My best releases were a platformer video game, BitRunner, using Unity in C# and Google Firebase for my IB Computer Science HL Assessment and my co-developed indie game called Worst Tanks. I am also passionate about working on and learning about cybersecurity and AI/ML projects.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing chess, working on motorcycle projects (still don't have my licence yet), and collecting vinyls; though my collection definetly needs some work.
